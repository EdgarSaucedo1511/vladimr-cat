        <p>Sadly we dont have any pictures of  the best boy today,<br> 
        however we will try to demonstrate his <b>cuteness</b> with other represantations</p>

        <h2>First we would like to star with a topic that not many people would choose to ignore</h2>
        <p><b>His features!</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>His ears:
                <p>Defenetly one of his beas qualities, just one look at them makes your heart skip a beat
                    ,if i could give him a kiss on those ear right now i would.</p>
